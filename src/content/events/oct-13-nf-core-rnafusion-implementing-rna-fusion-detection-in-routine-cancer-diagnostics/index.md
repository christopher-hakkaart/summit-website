An increased number of gene fusions are observed in several cancer types with possible impacts for cancer diagnostics and therapy selection. However, to operate in clinical settings, a robust and reproducible data analysis pipeline is necessary. We have developed the nf-core/rnafusion pipeline designed to examine gene fusions in RNA sequencing. nf-core/rnafusion uses the combination of five detection tools (STAR-Fusion, Arriba, FusionCatcher, SQUID & pizzly) to generate a combined comprehensive report of fusions events, using visualisation tools such as FusionInspector from STAR-Fusion and draw_fusions.R from Arriba to aid the clinical interpretation of results. A complete refactoring of the pipeline was achieved with DSL 2 syntax and additional tuning parameters were added and are being developed continuously to achieve optimal results on different library preparation protocols using community feedback and a range of validation data sets.
